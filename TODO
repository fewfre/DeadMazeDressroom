- Figure out what to do with the 60###_AC items (ranged weapons?)
- Add a way to show yellow/red durability weapons (other than just guitar)
- Add items asyn to dirty panes prevent freezing?
- Store what parts exist in a seperate file to allow skipping past item exist detection.
	- Would require it to be done on update, which would need to update script to be run through the swf?
